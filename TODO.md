# TODO
A list of features/amendments still to do

- Address generator (need to know the format of Litecash addresses, will look for npm module to do this)
- QR image generator (generate QR image from address string)
- QR scanner (browser request to use device camera, capture QR code and translate to address string)
- API endpoints (need a list of all API end points)
- Encryptions of data stored in browser (where will private keys be held?)
- Apply tight security policies (follow strict owasp guide and use online security scanners)
- Need to follow best pratices of popular web weallets like Meta Mask
